# Solution to exercise 1
# Read the initial deposit amount from the user
initial_deposit = float(input("Enter the initial deposit amount: "))

# Define the interest rate
interest_rate = 0.04

# Calculate the amount in the savings account after 1 year
amount_year_1 = initial_deposit * (1 + interest_rate)
print(f"Amount after 1 year: ${amount_year_1:.2f}")

# Calculate the amount in the savings account after 2 years
amount_year_2 = amount_year_1 * (1 + interest_rate)
print(f"Amount after 2 years: ${amount_year_2:.2f}")

# Calculate the amount in the savings account after 3 years
amount_year_3 = amount_year_2 * (1 + interest_rate)
print(f"Amount after 3 years: ${amount_year_3:.2f}")
