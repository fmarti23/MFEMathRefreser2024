Welcome to the 2024 MFE Math Refresher repository.



For the mfe environment we used in class, you need to install python (version 3.12), and the following packages are needed:

numpy pandas matplotlib plotly scipy statsmodels jupyter pandas-datareader

The following commands will install them

conda install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels
conda install pandas-datareader
conda install -c conda-forge statsmodels
conda install -c plotly plotly=5.23.0
conda install jupyter 


Remember we are using conda install because our environment was set up with conda! For any package you may need, google conda install and the name of the package. It is likely that somebody created an appropriate installation for it. It is not recommended that you install packages through pip (this is another installation command and may create conflicts with conda). Please refer to https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html and/or send me an email and we can troubleshoot anything you may be stuck in. My office is SSC 4036, and I will usually be there Monday-Friday but not Wednesdays. 


For those of you who want to use VS Code, do check Github Copilot (https://docs.github.com/en/copilot). This is an AI powered tool to help you debug or code instructions. Again, use technology to your advantage but be wary of it. If you guys know how to solve something by hand, coding it just means translating instructions into something the computer can understand. DO NOT rely on github or ChatGPT, you are way smarter than these tools. A hammer doesn't know how to do the work, unless you guide it...

Cheers,
Javier
